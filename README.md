# Smart Home Simulation
**Authors**: [Darina Mingazova](@mingadar), [Mikita A Citaroviƒç](@citarmik)
## Description
The main challenge for us was to realise an interesting smart home simulation using suitable design patterns. <br/>

- **F1 +** <br/>
All entities are located in the entity package.
- **F2 \*** <br/>
Our devices have no content. (didn't have time and considered it not basic :( )

## Design patterns
- **Singleton** <br/>
Used to store the basic system state and control of the system (start and end of the simulation, links to the main parts of the system).
- **Observer** <br/>
In our system, entities whose logic depends on time are subscribed to "time". 
- **State machine** <br/>
Each device and inhabitant have different states in which their behaviour may differ.
- **Event Bus** <br/>
Any entity can both subscribe to events and generate events. This allows for a fairly flexible expansion of the system and the addition of new logic.
- **Chain of Responsibility** <br/>
This pattern works in conjunction with the Event Bus, which allows for more flexible event handling.
- **Builder** <br/>
This pattern is used to create the configuration of our house
- **Factory method** <br/>
Used in conjunction with the builder to create items, devices, entrances and inhabitants.
- **An abstract factory** <br/>
Used in conjunction with the builder to create different types of sensors (internal and external).
- **Proxy** <br/>
In our case, the SHSystem class has a "start" method which, after some logic, triggers the "start" method of the Simulation class.
